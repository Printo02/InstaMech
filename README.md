ABSTRACT 

The Insta Mech project is a web application designed to offer immediate access to mechanic, crane, 
and carriage services for users experiencing vehicle breakdowns or other related issues while 
traveling. This application, provides a modern and responsive platform that ensures users can easily 
locate and contact service providers in their vicinity at any time, day or night. 
 
 This system addresses the current gap in roadside assistance services, where travelers often struggle 
to find help, especially in unfamiliar areas. This application helps to contact with verified service 
providers, and  the application offers a reliable solution that enhances user convenience and safety. 
 
The project consists of multiple user roles, including admins, service providers, and general users. 
Admins oversee the platform's operations, ensuring all registered service providers are authenticated 
and approved. Service providers can manage their profiles, view service requests, and communicate 
directly with users. General users can access detailed information about nearby services, send 
requests, and provide feedback. 
 
In summary, the "Insta Mech" project aims to revolutionize roadside assistance by providing an 
efficient, user-friendly, and secure platform that ensures help is just a click away, no matter where the 
user is located.
